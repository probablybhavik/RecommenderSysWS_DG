    "A recommender system or a recommendation system (sometimes replacing \"system\" with a synonym such as platform or engine) is a subclass of information filtering system that seeks to predict the \"rating\" or \"preference\" a user would give to an item.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommender systems have become increasingly popular in recent years, and are utilized in a variety of areas including movies, music, news, books, research articles, search queries, social tags, and products in general. There are also recommender systems for experts, collaborators, jokes, restaurants, garments, financial services, life insurance, romantic partners (online dating), and Twitter pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of companies rely heavily on their recommendation systems. Amazon gets a ton of sales from its recommendation system. Netflix has gained a ton of popularity for its recommendation system. In fact back in 2006 they even offered 1 million in prize money to anyone who would better their recommendation algorithm by 10%. (And the prize was claimed in 2009). Youtube does a great job at recommending videos, Spotify at recommending music and Facebook recommending pages you'd like to follow.\n",
    "In short we are well surrounded by Recommender Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at how these things work."
